       MMaann  looks for manual pages which describe each one of the
       named _T_O_P_I_C(s) in directories specified by  MMAANNPPAATTHH  envi-
       ronment  variable, and displays those pages.  If the stan-
       dard output is not a terminal,  or  if  the  _-  option  is
       given,  mmaann  writes the manual page(s) to standard output;
       otherwise, it pipes the page(s) through a program  defined
       by  the  PPAAGGEERR environment variable, to allow browsing and
       bold/underlined words to be displayed on the screen.

       MMAANNPPAATTHH is a list of directories separated  by  a  system-
       dependent separator: colon `::' on Unix systems, semi-colon
       `;;' on MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems.  Each directory in  this
       list  is assumed to contain either manual pages (files) or
       subdirectories named mmaann_N or ccaatt_N (where _N  is  a  section
       name) which contains manual pages.  MMaann does nnoott look more
       than one level deep into the subdirectories.  Any file  of
       the form _T_O_P_I_C..eexxtt found in any of the directories will be
       displayed, no matter what  is  the  extension  ..eexxtt;  this
       allows  to  browse  docs  with  file names like ffoooo..ttxxtt or
       bbaarr..ddoocc.  However, files found in the  standard  mmaann_N  and
       ccaatt_N  subdirectories  will  only be displayed if they have
       the standard extensions of Unix man pages, [[11--99]][[oonnllpp]].

       If MMAANNPPAATTHH is not defined, mmaann looks in a system-dependent
       default  list  of  directories; invoking mmaann with no argu-
       ments will print that default list.

       If PPAAGGEERR is not defined, it defaults to 'lleessss --cc'.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --      Write the output to standard output, even if it  is
              a  terminal.  By default, when standard output is a
              terminal, mmaann pipes its output through a pager pro-
              gram.

       --aa     Display  all  manual  pages  which match _T_O_P_I_C.  By
              default, mmaann displays the first page it finds.

       --ll     List all the manual pages which  match  _T_O_P_I_C,  but
              don't  display  them.  Each page is listed together
              with the --MM argument which, if used, will cause mmaann
              to display that page alone.

       --MM _D_I_R_L_I_S_T
              Specifies  an  alternate  search  path  for  manual
              pages.  _D_I_R_L_I_S_T is a list of directories  separated
              by  the  same separator as in the value of MMAANNPPAATTHH.

MAN(1)                                                     MAN(1)


              This option overrides the MMAANNPPAATTHH environment vari-
              able.

       --ss _S_E_C_T_I_O_N
              Specifies  the  section  of  the  manual for mmaann to
              search.  MMaann will only display pages from that sec-
              tion.  _S_E_C_T_I_O_N may be a digit perhaps followed by a
              letter, a letter from the set [oonnllpp], or one of the
              words `oolldd', `nneeww', `llooccaall' or `ppuubblliicc'.

              You  cannot specify more than a single section at a
              time, but you can specify multiple --ss  options,  as
              in ""--ss 11 ffoooo --ss 55 ffoooo"".

              A section name in short form only (11vv, nn, etc.) can
              also be given without preceeding  it  with  the  --ss
              switch.

       --vv     Causes mmaann to print messages about non-fatal errors
              it encounters during the run.

       --dd     Causes mmaann to display debugging trace of its run.

       MMAANNPPAATTHH
              This variable specifies the list of directories  to
              search for man pages.

       PPAAGGEERR  This  variable  specifies the program called by mmaann
              to display the man pages on user's screen.

       DDJJDDIIRR  If this variable is defined and  its  value  is  an
              existing   directory,  the  DJGPP  version  of  mmaann
              searches its mmaann and iinnffoo  subdirectories  of  that
              directory, in addition to the directories specified
              by MMAANNPPAATTHH.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Normally, the exit status is 0 if mmaann finds at  least  one
       man  page.   The  exit  status  is  2 if no man pages were
       found.  If no _T_O_P_I_C arguments were given,  mmaann  prints  an
       error message and returns with exit status of 1.  Invoking
       mmaann with no arguments at all causes it to print usage info
       and exit with status of 1.

BBUUGGSS
       Email bug reports to ddjjggpppp@@ddeelloorriiee..ccoomm.

       Relies  on  GGrrooffff  or  a  very close work-alike to display
       unformatted pages.

       Doesn't support preprocessing  with  vvggrriinndd  (since  GGrrooffff
       doesn't).

MAN(1)                                                     MAN(1)


       Supports  only  a  subset  of options provided by standard
       Unix mmaann commands.  In particular,  wwhhaattiiss  data-base  and
       related options (--ff, --kk) aren't supported.

       Multiple sections (--ss 22,,33,,88) aren't supported.  Use multi-
       ple --ss requests to work around.

       ""mmaann ffoooo"" will happily try to display ffoooo..ttggzz if it  finds
       it,  since  it  doesn't  care too much about the file-name
       extension.

       MMaann is relatively slow on large directories.
